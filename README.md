 ```

This is a web application that allows users to predict the price of a used bike based on its features. The app is built using Flask, a Python microframework, and uses a machine learning model to make predictions.

Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* Python 3.6 or later
* Flask
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Pickle
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scipy
* Datetime
* LabelEncoder



You can install these dependencies using pip:


pip install flask numpy scikit-learn pickle matplotlib seaborn scipy datetime LabelEncoder
```

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can clone the repository and start the app:

```
https://github.com/yadav-Simran/Old-Bike-Prediction/
cd Bike-Resale-Prediction-app
python app.py
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:5000.

### Using the App

To use the app, you will need to provide the following information about the bike:

* Bike Company
* Bike Model
* Remaining Warranty
* Engine Type
* Fuel Type
* CC
* Fuel Capacity

Once you have provided this information, the app will use the machine learning model to predict the price of the bike.

### The Machine Learning Model

The machine learning model used by the app is a gradient boosting model. This model was trained on a dataset of used bike prices. The model is able to predict the price of a bike with a high degree of accuracy.

### Deployment

The app is deployed to Heroku. You can find the deployment instructions in the `Procfile` file.

### Conclusion

This app is a simple example of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems. The app is easy to use and can provide valuable information to users who are looking to buy or sell a used bike.
